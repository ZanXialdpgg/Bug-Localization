# Bug-Localization

This is my implementation for this paper https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9719906 "An Imbalanced Deep Learning Model for Bug Localization"

This work proposes a deep neural network model to improve automated bug localization by tackling two major challenges: the lexical gap between natural language bug reports and source code, and the imbalance of training datasets.
The model integrates lexical similarity, semantic embeddings, historical bug reports, code change history, and bug-fixing frequency into a unified feature set
